	<h1>Hello</h1>
	<h2>
		My name is Nicholas C.<br/>aka Nickc01
	<h2/>
	<h3>
		Ever since I was a few years old, I have always had a passion for video games. I believe video games are an incredible art form that is not only a form of entertainment, but a way to communicate a story.<br/><br/>
		I have over 10 years of experience with programming, with over 6 in Game Engine experience, especially with the Unity Engine. I know languages such as C#, C++, Javascript, and Lua.<br/><br/>
		My most recent projects have been mods for the game Hollow Knight, a 2D metroidvania game I have been very interested in for a while now. The mods I've been making for it have been taking existing boss fights, and giving them my own twist, going as far as restructuring the fight completely. <br/><br/>You can see this and other work in the "Projects" section
